Segmentation Task:
I made two trials —
the **final and correct version** is in the **notebook loss_Functions_Introduced.ipynb.**  Kindly run this notebook for training.
first trial was to explore the dataset and do augmentation Notebook **Modanet_Trial1** **Not final sloution**


I also **added inference on real web images**. Please download the trained weights from the following link to test on real images (not only the test set):
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jZ9qvr0Yn5ehvPpH-I4-6sfTG5mztxhZ/view?usp=sharing
And **Run seg_Inference.ipynb with the web images**
The **pdf is presented in segmentation task.pdf**

Generation Task:
Please run the corresponding notebook  Gen_trial 3.ipynb— it also requires the segmentation weights I trained.
Kindly use the same weights from the Drive link above.
pdf is also found in **stable diffusion inpainting pdf** with **the generated images**
⚠️ Note: When performing inference with the second model in Colab, restart the session first, as RAM may run out.
