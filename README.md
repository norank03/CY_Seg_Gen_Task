Segmentation Task:
I made two trials — the final and correct version is in the notebook loss_Functions_Introduced.ipynb.
Kindly run this notebook for training.

I also added inference on real web images. Please download the trained weights from the following link to test on real images (not only the test set):

Generation Task:
Please run the corresponding notebook — it also requires the segmentation weights I trained.
Kindly use the same weights from the Drive link above.
⚠️ Note: When performing inference with the second model in Colab, restart the session first, as RAM may run out.
