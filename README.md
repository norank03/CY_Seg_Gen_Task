**Segmentation Task**:
I made two trials —
the **final and correct version** is in the **notebook loss_Functions_Introduced1.ipynb.**  Kindly run this notebook for training.
first trial was to explore the dataset and do augmentation Notebook **Modanet_Trial1**  **Not final sloution**


I also **added inference on real web images**. Please download the trained weights from the following link to test on real images :
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jZ9qvr0Yn5ehvPpH-I4-6sfTG5mztxhZ/view?usp=sharing
And **Run seg_Inference1.ipynb with the web images you choose just add them in the images folder**

The **pdf is presented in segmentation task.pdf**

**Generation Task**: **Generated image are in the last page of the pdf** 
Please run the corresponding **notebook  Gen_trial 3.ipynb—** it also requires the segmentation weights I trained for Clothes.
Kindly use the same weights from the Drive link above.
**pdf** is also found in **Stable diffusion inpainting task clothes and background** with **the generated images**

** Note **: When performing inference with the second model in Colab, restart the session first, as RAM may run out.
